// mongoose.connection.close()-->to close the connection!

// Define the Schema for your model(collection in layman's terms(mongoDb's terms)!!!) like below--->
const userSchema = new mongoose.Schema({
  name: String,
  avatar: String,
  email: String,
  role: String,
  date: { type: Date, default: Date.now }, //<--note that this value if not provided, will automatically be added by mongodb.
}); //this is basically like a blueprint of how each document of your collection should look like.

// now we create a model by specifying the name of the model as first argument and the above schema as the second argument.
//**note that we name the model here with Capitalized notation and also singular but mongoose will create a collection in your database automatically and name it in small letters and also pluralize it.we can check this on the gui of atlas or compass to see what happens)
export const User = mongoose.models.User || mongoose.model("User", userSchema);
//This...^... now contains a pointer to your collection now.
//you can perform queries, add, delete etc using this.
//note that you could export this model from here and import it anywhere in any file and perform any operations on this collection/model.

/*#-->now as all operations with the database are async,
   So generally we follow this approach to create async functions for anything we want to do
   #->note that we typically send the response back wherever you see the console log. it's for testing and debugging purposes.
   for logging we don't typically use console log in production
   -->we often use third party logging services such as winston.
